@article{Okazaki.2013,
 abstract = {Ubiquity has been referred to as one of the most important characteristics of mobile services. In this study, an instrument for the measurement of perceived ubiquity reflecting the benefits derived from continuity, immediacy, portability, and searchability is developed using a multiple-stage approach. In the initial stage, perceived ubiquity is conceptualized through interdisciplinary perspectives as a multidimensional, 32-item eight-factor construct. In the second stage, the original measurement is pretested on a student sample and recalibrated into a 16-item four-factor instrument. In the third stage, general consumers are invited to complete a task in which they are asked to perform a search with a mobile device before rating the measurement items. A confirmatory factor analysis produces a 12-item four-factor instrument. Furthermore, a second-order structure results from a statistical comparison of alternative models through a competing model strategy. In the final stage, we use a scenario method to validate the measurement tool while establishing discriminant, nomological, and known-group validities. The thorough validation results demonstrate the value of our instrument as a measurement tool of perceived ubiquity that is useful in describing the unique nature of mobile devices and predicting differences in user perceptions of mobile services and desktop PC services. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, important limitations are recognized and future research directions are suggested.},

@article{Ward.2017,
 abstract = {AbstractOur smartphones enable---and encourage---constant connection to information, entertainment, and each other. They put the world at our fingertips, and rarely leave our sides. Although these devices have immense potential to improve welfare, their persistent presence may come at a cognitive cost. In this research, we test the ``brain drain'' hypothesis that the mere presence of one's own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance. Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention---as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones---the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making and consumer welfare.},
